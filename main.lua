-- Running Shoes
--
-- Hold B and walk faster. Gen 3 gave them to you in the first five minutes;
-- Gen 1 made you wait for a bicycle.
--
-- ------- how it works
--
-- The engine hands a step's duration through the `movement.speed` hook,
-- whose own comment in src/world/Player.lua names running shoes as the
-- reason it exists -- so this mod is the intended shape, not a workaround.
-- A step is a frame count, and lower is faster:
--
--   16  walking, the vanilla number
--    8  bicycle (which is exactly twice walking, hence "doubles")
--
-- The hook is asked for a number and hands one back. Nothing else is
-- touched -- not collision, not the animation, not the step itself -- so a
-- tile still costs a tile and the world does not care how fast you crossed
-- it. This is a duration knob, and duration is the only thing in it.
--
-- ------- the floor
--
-- Steps are counted in whole frames, so the fast end runs out of road: at
-- x4 a step is four frames, and the next multiplier down would be three,
-- then two, then one -- at which point a tile passes in 1/60th of a second
-- and the walk cycle is a strobe. The ladder stops where the animation
-- still reads as walking rather than teleporting.

-- ------- the one place a duration knob is not just a duration
--
-- `movement.speed` is asked on a MANUAL step, and the answer is stored on
-- the player as `stepFramesCur` (src/world/Player.lua). A SCRIPTED step --
-- the guide who walks you to the Poke Mart, Oak marching you to his lab --
-- is not started through `tryMove`: OverworldState:updateScriptMoves sets
-- `moving` and `progress` directly and never touches `stepFramesCur`.
--
-- So a scripted step reuses whatever the last manual step left there.
-- Measured, on a real Player:
--
--     scripted step, no run before it     16 frames
--     scripted step after a running step    8 frames
--
-- The escort NPC has no such knob -- src/world/NPC.lua keeps its own
-- STEP_FRAMES = 16 and never consults this hook -- so the player crosses
-- two tiles for the guide's one, walks out of the scene, and the dialogue
-- fires late against a player who is no longer where the script put him.
--
-- And it happens nearly every time, because the button that advances the
-- dialogue you are being escorted out of is B, which is also the button
-- that makes you run. You mash B, the last step before the cutscene is a
-- running step, and the cutscene inherits it.
--
-- Vanilla leaves 16 there (8 on the bicycle), which is exactly what the
-- NPCs use. So this is ours to clean up: put back what the engine would
-- have left, the moment the player is standing still.
