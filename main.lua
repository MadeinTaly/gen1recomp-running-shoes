-- Running Shoes
--
-- Hold B and walk faster. Gen 3 gave them to you in the first five minutes;
-- Gen 1 made you wait for a bicycle.
--
-- ------- how it works
--
-- The engine hands a step's duration through the `movement.speed` hook,
-- whose own comment in src/world/Player.lua names running shoes as the
-- reason it exists -- so this mod is the intended shape, not a workaround.
-- A step is a frame count, and lower is faster:
--
--   16  walking, the vanilla number
--    8  bicycle (which is exactly twice walking, hence "doubles")
--
-- The hook is asked for a number and hands one back. Nothing else is
-- touched -- not collision, not the animation, not the step itself -- so a
-- tile still costs a tile and the world does not care how fast you crossed
-- it. This is a duration knob, and duration is the only thing in it.
--
-- ------- the floor
--
-- Steps are counted in whole frames, so the fast end runs out of road: at
-- x4 a step is four frames, and the next multiplier down would be three,
-- then two, then one -- at which point a tile passes in 1/60th of a second
-- and the walk cycle is a strobe. The ladder stops where the animation
-- still reads as walking rather than teleporting.

local MIN_FRAMES = 4     -- see "the floor" above
